	Everyone is curious about the life after death and have many unanswered questions. But God is good. From time to time, He answers His children’s questions and doubts. This short book presents a moving testimony of one Sister Aidah Nakasujja, who was chosen by God to let the world know of the reality of heaven and hell. Sister Aidah was in the year 2007 taken out of this life. Jesus took her on a tour of the wonders of heaven and horrors of Hell. Jesus showed her what happens to souls when they die, what happens to unbelievers and to servants of God who don't obey their calling. Sister Aidah, who herself had not fulfilled God’s calling on her life while on earth, was given a second chance and mission to go back and warn the lost, the backslidden, and the lukewarm on earth with an urgent message.  She recounts all the details of what she saw with such precision that it captivates the listener from start to finish. As she relates her experiences, you will feel as though you are right with her, visiting the heavenly kingdom of God, under the close guidance and watch of heavenly angels! In this book:
	You will wonder at the glory and immensity of what God has prepared for those who love Him; and the horrors and misery that awaits those who reject or disobey Him!
	You will have a glimpse of the unimaginable paradise prepared for obedient Christians and the doom waiting for disobedient Christians, and those whose lives are full of sin!
